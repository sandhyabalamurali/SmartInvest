#  SMART INVEST - AN AGENTIC AI SYSTEM FOR INVESTMENT DECISION SUPPORT

---

## Small Description

The project focuses on developing an intelligent Agentic AI system for supporting retail investors in managing SIPs, mutual funds, and direct stock investments. It aims to improve investment decision-making by analyzing user profiles, market trends, portfolio risks, and emotional behavior, thereby helping investors make disciplined, data-driven, and personalized financial choices.

## About

Agentic AI–Based Personalized SIP, Mutual Fund and Stock Decision Support System is designed to assist investors by providing adaptive and explainable investment insights instead of direct trading actions. Traditional investment platforms rely on static analytics, predefined questionnaires, and limited personalization, which often fail to consider dynamic market changes and investor behavior. As a result, investors may panic during market volatility, stop SIPs, or unknowingly concentrate risk.

This project overcomes these challenges by integrating multiple AI agents that analyze user risk profiles, stock volatility, mutual fund NAV trends, portfolio overlap, and emotional patterns. The system continuously monitors both financial and behavioral data to guide users with transparent and understandable suggestions such as SIP step-up, rebalancing, and diversification improvements. The goal is to provide a safe, human-centric, and explainable decision support framework for long-term wealth creation.

## System Architecture

The system follows an Agentic AI architecture where multiple intelligent agents collaborate:

- **User Profiling Agent** – Determines investor risk appetite  
- **Stock Analysis Agent** – Evaluates volatility and sector exposure  
- **Mutual Fund & SIP Agent** – Analyzes NAV trends and SIP patterns  
- **Portfolio Allocation Agent** – Detects overlap and diversification level  
- **Emotion & Behavior Agent** – Identifies fear, greed, and panic from user inputs  
- **Explainability Agent** – Converts AI outputs into simple, human-readable insights  

These agents interact with the FastAPI backend, market data APIs, and a user dashboard to provide continuous decision support.

##  Results and Impact

The Agentic AI Decision Support System improves the way retail investors interact with financial data by transforming raw market information into personalized and explainable insights. It reduces panic-driven actions, enhances diversification, and supports disciplined SIP investing. By integrating behavioral intelligence with financial analytics, the system bridges the gap between technology and human psychology.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Agentic AI in FinTech and serves as a foundation for future intelligent wealth management platforms that are secure, transparent, and human-centric.
